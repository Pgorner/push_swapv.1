									Stack
================================================================================
	A Stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure. The ðŸ„¿ðŸ…„ðŸ…‚ðŸ„· and ðŸ…¿ðŸ…¾ðŸ…¿
	operations are simple. ðŸ„¿ðŸ…„ðŸ…‚ðŸ„· puts something on the stack, ðŸ…¿ðŸ…¾ðŸ…¿ takes
	something off. You put onto the top, and take off the top, to preserve
	the LIFO order.

================================================================================
			Visualization Stack ðŸ„¿ðŸ…„ðŸ…‚ðŸ„·ing && ðŸ…¿ðŸ…¾ðŸ…¿ping
================================================================================
Empty Stack:
|     |
|     |
|     |
-------
After ðŸ„¿ðŸ…„ðŸ…‚ðŸ„·ing A, you get:
|     |
|     |
|  A  |
-------
After ðŸ„¿ðŸ…„ðŸ…‚ðŸ„·ing B, you get:
|     |
|  B  |
|  A  |
-------
After ðŸ…¿ðŸ…¾ðŸ…¿ping, you get:
|     |
|     |
|  A  |
-------
After ðŸ„¿ðŸ…„ðŸ…‚ðŸ„·ing C, you get:
|     |
|  C  |
|  A  |
-------
After ðŸ…¿ðŸ…¾ðŸ…¿ping, you get:

			What should swap and rotate on a 1-element stack do?
================================================================================
	Do nothing leave as is ??

================================================================================
					What should ðŸ„¿ðŸ…„ðŸ…‚ðŸ„· with NULL be?
================================================================================
	"ðŸ„¿ðŸ…„ðŸ…‚ðŸ„· 0"
	"null can be ðŸ„¿ðŸ…„ðŸ…‚ðŸ„·ed onto the Stack as a placeholder, if needed. It occupies
	a slot in the stack and is treated like any object."

================================================================================
			What should be the result of ðŸ…¿ðŸ…¾ðŸ…¿ping an empty stack?
================================================================================
	Nothing -- ðŸ…¿ðŸ…¾ðŸ…¿ should only be done if Stack isnt empty
